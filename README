BUILDING SEQUEL PRO
-------------------

Sequel Pro uses two external frameworks which come with .ibplugins (Interface Builder
Plugins); to build Sequel Pro, Interface Builder must have detected these plugins.

The two frameworks are:
	BWToolkit
	ShortcutRecorder

Each of these frameworks is included in the Sequel Pro source tree with its .ibplugin;
the locations of these .ibplugins are:
	./Frameworks/BWToolkitFramework.framework/Versions/A/Resources/BWToolkit.ibplugin
	./Frameworks/ShortcutRecorder.framework/Versions/A/Resources/ShortcutRecorder.ibplugin

By including these .ibplugins within the frameworks, Interface Builder should detect them automatically when you build.  If you get build errors about "Unable to resolve plug-in 
dependency for É", automatic detection has failed.  The first thing to try is to quit Xcode 
and Interface Builder, re-open Xcode, and try again; if this still fails, locate 
the .ibplugins and double click on them to add them to Interface Builder.

If Interface Builder complains that it's already installed then you might want 
to replace the current version with the version in the project; to do this go to the
Interface Builder preferences, click on 'Plugins', and remove the BWToolkit plugin
using the [ - ] button below the list.

You will need to relaunch Interface Builder before you can re-add the plugin 
from the location mentioned above.

Note, that Interface Builder always looks in the same location that the plugin 
was originally installed from and does not keep track of it when moved. If
Interface Builder complains that it can't find it, either restore it to its 
originally location or re-add it using the steps above.

As a last resort jump onto IRC and join #sequel-pro on irc.freenode.net and 
any of the developers will be happy to help you out.
